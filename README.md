Amplification results of 2-26-2020 in Table 32 was performed employing the following conditions and 15a/15b primers: (1) Denaturation at 940C for 3 min; (2) 35 cycles of 940C for 30 s, 500C for 45 s, and 720C for 1 min; and (3) a final extension at 720C for 5 min.  Illustra PuReTaq™ Ready-to-Go PCR beads in 0.5 µl tubes were used as the PCR reaction mixture, which consists of a 25 µl reaction volume with approximately 2.5 units PuReTaq polymerase, 200 µM dNTP (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), BSA, stabilizers and reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2).  For the negative control 1 µl primer and 24 µl nuclease-free water and positive control 1 µl primer, 1-3 ul DNA virus template and 21-23 µl nuclease-free water was used for amplification. DNA samples (3-5 µl) were run on a 1.5% Metaphor gel (TBE buffer, pH 8.3) with a Beijing Liuyi DYY-C6 power supply at a constant 120 v, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed with a BioRad GelDoc XR+ imager. The virus isolates were expected to generated a DNA amplicon sizes of 945 bp.




Some of the samples showed amplification including two of the positive controls; however, the size of the DNA amplicons was difficult to determine and appeared to be somewhat smaller than the expected fragments as predicted from the 15a/15b primers.
